# Security System
## Intro

This project came to me one day when I was working at job and observed a security system. I started to think that I could build one but then as I got to think about it even more it wasn't so much about building it as just trying some things out in PHP and Javascript. 

I've not used PHP for a long time - something that I regret so I'm mainly using this project more of a review. I've also not used vanilla JavaScript forever so there's that as well!
